In this project, we use Excel for comprehensive data analysis on the 'Bike_buyers.xlsx' dataset. This includes data cleaning, creating pivot tables, and building a dashboard. 
For data cleaning, we remove duplicates, drop unnecessary columns, strip irrelevant data, and use functions such as nested IF statements and IFERROR for value categorization. 
For the pivot tables, we generate various visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and more.

The final visualization is an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter, slice, and drill down into the data, making it easier for customers to track information and gain deeper insights.
